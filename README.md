This provides example to interface Stone HMI, Daly BMS and Motor Controller.

The HMI shows the vitals of battery and Motor Vitals vitals such as SOC, Battery , Pack Voltage, Pack Current, Temp, Max Cell Volatge , Min Cell Voltage ,
Motor Speed RH and LH and Temperature.

Check Actual Implementation at CAN_TEST -> Project, all the C files here contains the logic and interface.
